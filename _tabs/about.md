I am proficient in C++, Python and ROS. I have a passion for robotics and writing code in C++.

# Past Projects

## Autonomous Pick and Go Rover

This was a group project for a Mechatronics class. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous rover that would find a misplaced wooden block in a maze and place it at a goal point. The robot's initial position was randomly chosen so we had to solve the kidnapped robot problem.

## Robot Exploration

This was a group project for a robotics course. The objective of the project was to program a Turtlebot to autonomously explore a maze and map it using Gmapping. Our design used a combination of frontier exploration, bug algorithm and A\* to explore it's environment.

## Virtual Bumper

I did this project during the summer of 2018 at the Australian Center for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney. Prior to my design, the vehicle's obstacle detection system was only capable of working on flat ground and was prone to frequent false positive detections. My design drastically reduced the system's false positive rates, allowed it to work on all drivable surfaces at a fraction of the previous system's runtime.

## Autonomous Wheelchair Project

I did this project during the summer of 2017 alongside my partner Ayaan at Lund University. Using an Xbox Kinect, a laptop and some spare electronic parts we transformed an electric wheelchair into an autonous navigation robot. This was my first full-fledged robotics project and it was an excellent learning experience.
